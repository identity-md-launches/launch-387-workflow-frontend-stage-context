/**
 * @notice A live ETH/TOKEN launch pool with the hook installed, seeded with the entire supply.
 *
 * Extending this gives a test everything a hook needs to be exercised against: an initialized pool
 * whose `hooks` field is our hook, the full one billion {LaunchToken} placed as liquidity, ETH to
 * spend, and routers to swap and modify liquidity through. A test for new behaviour needs no setup
 * of its own — swap, then assert.
 *
 * ## The pool
 *
 * `currency0` is native ETH and `currency1` is the token, which is the ordering v4 forces (address
 * zero sorts first) and the one a real launch uses. Native ETH is deliberate: it settles differently
 * from an ERC20, and that difference is where hooks most often break.
 *
 * All liquidity sits *below* the starting tick, so seeding it costs no ETH — the position is pure
 * token. Buyers swap ETH in (`zeroForOne`), which walks the pool price down through the range and
 * hands out token; the price of the token *in ETH* therefore rises as it is bought, which is the
 * launch curve. The pool accumulates the ETH.
 *
 * ## What is inherited
 *
 * From {Deployers}: `manager`, `key`, `swapRouter`, `modifyLiquidityRouter`, `donateRouter`,
 * `ZERO_BYTES`, and `swap(key, zeroForOne, amountSpecified, hookData)` — a negative amount is
 * exact-input. From here: `hook`, `token`, `tickLower` / `tickUpper`.
